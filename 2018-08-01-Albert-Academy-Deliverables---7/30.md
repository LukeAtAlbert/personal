Up to this point, the plan of action was to develop Albert Academy alongside the new static pages being released in early September, using a CMS for the creation and management of both. 

This presents one large issue, in that the upkeep of Albert Academy is very different from that of the the static pages. With this in mind, the _expected_ course of action we plan to take is to use Dennis to manage Albert Academy, affecting the project in a few key ways:

* Because all of Dennis is managed internally, the time required for creating an internal CMS in Dennis pushes launch to mid to late September

* This could allow us to use Accredible's API in the Albert app, potentially allowing use the certification in new ways (intercom messages, locked content, etc.)

With that in mind, the next six weeks of deliverables are outlined below.
